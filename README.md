# SIMON

## A Game inspired by Always sunny scene [Charlie Plays Simon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoY3Q6qHuXs)

### Instructions to Run 

1. Install python
2. pip install pygame

### Tested with python3.8 and pygame 2.3

## To Play

You will just need to follow the patter with either 2 4 6 8 on numpad or other keyboard

## Improvements

I will like to make it go towards learning music notes one by one and make it a keyboard based game
